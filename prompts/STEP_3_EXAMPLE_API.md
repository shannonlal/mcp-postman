Implementation Plan for Sample Express Server with Postman Tests:

Dependencies Required (devDependencies):
{
"devDependencies": {
"@types/express": "^4.17.x",
"@types/node": "^20.x.x",
"express": "^4.18.x",
"typescript": "^5.x.x"
}
}
Example Directory Structure:
example/
├── src/
│ └── server.ts # Express server implementation
├── postman/
│ ├── collection.json # Postman collection file
│ └── environment.json # Postman environment file
├── package.json # Project dependencies
└── tsconfig.json # TypeScript configuration
Server Implementation Plan (server.ts):
Create an Express server with two endpoints:
GET /api/items - Returns a list of sample items
POST /api/items - Accepts a new item and returns the created item
Server will run on port 3000
Include proper TypeScript types for request/response objects
Implement basic error handling
Add request logging middleware
Postman Environment (environment.json):
{
"name": "Sample API Environment",
"values": [
{
"key": "baseUrl",
"value": "http://localhost:3000",
"type": "default",
"enabled": true
}
]
}
Postman Collection Plan (collection.json):
Collection Name: "Sample API Tests"
Two request folders:
GET Requests
Test endpoint: GET {{baseUrl}}/api/items
Tests to verify:
Status code is 200
Response is an array
Response time is acceptable
POST Requests
Test endpoint: POST {{baseUrl}}/api/items
Request body: JSON object with item details
Tests to verify:
Status code is 201
Response contains created item
Response matches request schema
Additional Considerations:

Error Handling:

Implement proper HTTP status codes
Return meaningful error messages
Add request validation
TypeScript Types:

Define interfaces for request/response objects
Use proper type annotations
Ensure strict type checking
Testing Strategy:

Collection will include pre-request scripts
Environment variables for configuration
Test assertions for each endpoint
Response schema validation
Documentation:

Add API documentation in collection
Include example requests/responses
Document environment setup
This implementation plan provides a structured approach to creating a sample Express server with Postman tests while maintaining TypeScript best practices and proper testing coverage.
